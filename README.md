Maleficus
=========

What is it?
-----------
Maleficus is a Magic/RPG style plugin for Bukkit. The name Maleficus comes from the Latin word for 'Wizard', which I thought would suit it well as it has spells and stuff like that.

Inspired by Zephyrus (Plugin), Bending (Plugin) and Log Horizon (Anime), I bring you Maleficus.

When will it be released?
-------------------------
No idea :P

What features does it have?
---------------------------
Maleficus is both complex, but was aimed to be easy to use. Basically, there are 3 main features to Maleficus:
# Elements
# Powers
# Anima and levelling

=== [Elements]
In Maleficus, there are 8 elements:
* Water - Power over water and ice
* Fire - Power over fire and lava
* Earth - Power over the ground/stone etc.
* Air - Power over air
* Shock (Electric) - Power over electricity (lightning)
* Light - A 'pure' element which focuses on defence
* Dark - An 'evil' element which focuses on power
* Void - A discrete element with unimaginable power
Following these elements, there are also subElements:
* Beserker - Extra damage to attacks (short range)
* Archer - Extra damage to attacks (long range)
* Explosions - Causes explosions with attacks
* Healer - Heals yourself with attacks
* Speed - Uses less anima, but attacks are weaker
* Strength - Attacks are stronger, but uses more anima
* AntiAnima - Only uses 50% anima for attack and uses up entire antiAnima energy.
