Maleficus
=========

What is it?
-----------
Maleficus is a Magic/RPG style plugin for Bukkit. The name Maleficus comes from the Latin word for 'Wizard', which I thought would suit it well as it has spells and stuff like that.

Inspired by Zephyrus (Plugin), Bending (Plugin) and Log Horizon (Anime), I bring you Maleficus.

When will it be released?
-------------------------
No idea :P

What features does it have?
---------------------------
Maleficus is both complex, but was aimed to be easy to use. Basically, there are 3 main features to Maleficus:
* Elements
* Powers
* Anima and levelling

[Elements]
----------
In Maleficus, there are 8 elements:
* Water - Power over water and ice
* Fire - Power over fire and lava
* Earth - Power over the ground/stone etc.
* Air - Power over air
* Shock (Electric) - Power over electricity (lightning)
* Light - A 'pure' element which focuses on defence
* Dark - An 'evil' element which focuses on power
* Void - A discrete element with unimaginable power
Following these elements, there are also subElements:
* Beserker - Extra damage to attacks (short range)
* Archer - Extra damage to attacks (long range)
* Explosions - Causes explosions with attacks
* Healer - Heals yourself with attacks
* Speed - Uses less anima, but attacks are weaker
* Strength - Attacks are stronger, but uses more anima
* AntiAnima - Only uses 50% anima for attack and uses up entire antiAnima energy.

[Powers]
--------
Each element has 4 main powers, as well as 1 really powerful power.
For example, with Fire, there are 4 main attacks (BurningWorld, Fireball, LavaCannon) and then there is Meteor, which is REALLY powerful.

With each power, you are able to use a subelement (if you want). For example, I could use the 'fireball' power along with the archer subelement so that the fireball does more damage (and fireball is a long range attack).
Alternatively, I could use Shock's 'bolt' power along with the explosions subelement to make explosions when I use the bolt power.

[Anima and Levelling]
---------------------
Anima is the 'mana' the 'energy' required to execute a power. When you use an attack, a certain amount of your anima is taken. Anima is restored over time (and when you kill enemies?).

SubAnima is anima which is used by the AntiAnima subelement. When you use the AntiAnima subelement with a power, the anima taken is only 50% of what it normally would be, however it drains your SubAnima bar.

Anima levels can be increased by levelling which is done by (I have no idea -.-)
