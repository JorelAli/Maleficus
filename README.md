Maleficus
=========

What is it?
-----------
Maleficus is a Magic/RPG style plugin for Bukkit. The name Maleficus comes from the Latin word for 'Wizard', which I thought would suit it well as it has spells and stuff like that.

Inspired by Zephyrus (Plugin), Bending (Plugin) and Log Horizon (Anime), I bring you Maleficus.

When will it be released?
-------------------------
No idea :P

What features does it have?
---------------------------
Maleficus is both complex, but was aimed to be easy to use. Basically, there are 3 main features to Maleficus:
[1] Elements
[2] Powers
[3] Anima and levelling

[Elements]
In Maleficus, there are some 'main' elements which are Water, Fire, Earth, Air, Shock (electric), Light, Dark and Void.
